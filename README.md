### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm student at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Information Science and minoring in Philosophy. My journey through academia has been fueled by a seated passion for utilizing data to solve complex, impactful problems, particularly at the intersection of data and morality.

My internships at CloudQuant and RJ O’Brien have equipped me with hands-on experience in data science, from expanding data catalogs with over 8000 datasets to engineering automated risk reports. These experiences have honed my technical skills and instilled in me a strong commitment to driving results.

Beyond the technical, my philosophical studies have been equally transformative, offering me insights into analytical thinking and the moral dimensions of technology. This unique blend of skills and perspectives enables me to approach data science with a balanced lens of efficiency and ethical responsibility.

I am on the lookout for opportunities that challenge me to expand my data skills, in an environment of continuous learning and innovation. My goal is to contribute to projects that not only drive technological advancement but also consider the broader societal impact, embodying the values of accountability and progress.
