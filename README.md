### About Me

I'm student at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Information Science and minoring in Philosophy. My journey through academia has been fueled by a seated passion for utilizing data to solve complex, impactful problems, particularly at the intersection of data and morality.

I am on the lookout for opportunities that challenge me to expand my data skills, in an environment of continuous learning and innovation. My goal is to contribute to projects that not only drive technological advancement but also consider the broader societal impact, embodying the values of accountability and progress.
